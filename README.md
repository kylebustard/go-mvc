## Go MVC

The Go community promotes _Domain Driven Design_. 
That is different from _MVC_ architecure.
I followed along with a Pluralsight Go course, and even though the video was from 2018 or 2019 the _MVC_ architecture was still used.
I'll probably add tests to this later and then reimplement the app with _DDD_ architecture.
